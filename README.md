# InstaClone
InstaClone is exactly what it sounds like; a study of the popular social media app Instagram recreated using SwiftUI for front end development and a Firebase backend to support the features within the application

### 💻 Tech Stack:
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- iOS SDK
- Kingfisher SDK
- Firebase SDK: Auth, Storage, Firestore

### 🗒️ Features:
This project closely resembles the functionality of the widely-used Instagram app, enabling users to upload photos and distribute them on a shared feed visible to all. In addition to this primary feature, users can navigate through profiles of others, interact with content by liking and commenting. While the foundational features reminiscent of Instagram are established, it's important to acknowledge that the project remains a work in progress. There are plans to integrate additional features that will enrich the user experience and enhance the functionality of the application. These forthcoming additions aim to bring the app closer to the comprehensive capabilities offered by the fully developed Instagram application, ensuring heightened user engagement and satisfaction.

### ⚙️ Process:
My understanding of SwiftUI was not comprehensive prior to undertaking this project. At the time, SwiftUI was undergoing a transitional phase as Swift/iOS development evolved beyond UIKit. I aimed to embrace proficiency in both frameworks. Working with SwiftUI proved to be a more enjoyable experience, thanks to its rapid UI implementation capabilities. This efficiency allowed me to allocate more time and energy to refining the intricate logic of the application. Although I initially encountered challenges in navigating the disparities between SwiftUI and UIKit, spending several hours writing code in SwiftUI actually fostered a greater appreciation for its features and potential.

### 💭 Learnings:
Throughout this endeavor, I expanded my knowledge of SwiftUI and am committed to furthering my expertise in this domain. Additionally, I leveraged Firebase database services, enabling the creation of backend functionalities that emulate real-life scenarios, including data fetching, caching, and display. This integration has provided invaluable insights into handling data in practical contexts, enriching my understanding and skill set in app development.

### 🔨 Improvements:
🏗️🔧
**Works in Progress**
- Improved feed view with number of comments
- Settings for the account
- Activity display for user
- Follow actions
- Searchability
- Fixes for the images, allow rescale and cropping
- Post editing/removal
